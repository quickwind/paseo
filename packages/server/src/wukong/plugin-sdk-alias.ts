// knows the renamed SDK, so a Paseo plugin would not build. The compiler maps the upstream name
// to this build's name, which makes Paseo's plugins work unchanged.
//
// The upstream scope is written in two pieces so the publish-time rename leaves it alone. In an
// unrenamed source tree both names are the same and nothing is mapped.
