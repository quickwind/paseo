# Wukong

Wukong is Paseo for company machines: Claude Code and Devin CLI only, the company GitLab as the
only forge, and no traffic from Paseo itself to cloud services. It is the `wukong` branch of this
fork. Everything Wukong adds lives in a few directories so that syncing with upstream stays cheap.

Upstream files Wukong touches are marked `// Wukong`: `rg "// Wukong"` lists every one of them.
They are a handful of one-line hooks, not rewrites.

## What Wukong does

- **No cloud traffic from the daemon.** One hook on `net.Socket#connect` refuses every
  connection that is not loopback, a local socket or a host in `WUKONG_ALLOWED_HOSTS`, and the
  daemon refuses to listen on anything but loopback. That covers relay, Hub, push, registries,
  update checks and whatever upstream adds later. Child processes (the provider CLIs, `git`,
  `python-gitlab`) are outside the daemon and unaffected.
- **Providers:** Claude Code and Devin CLI. Devin is a configured ACP provider (`devin acp`).
  Other providers are removed from the registry, not just disabled.
- **Plugins:** local directories only, plus the bundled `wukong-gitlab`. npm, Git and registry
  installs and the other bundled plugins are off.
- **Voice:** dictation, voice mode and speech model downloads are off.
- **Web UI:** served by the daemon by default. Built with `EXPO_PUBLIC_WUKONG=1`, it has no voice
  buttons, no upstream links, no What's new, no pairing-link option, and every Add Project entry
  opens the GitLab screen.

## GitLab

Put the company GitLab in `<Paseo home>/wukong.json` (default `~/.paseo/wukong.json`):

```json
{
  "gitlab": {
    "url": "https://gitlab.example.com",
    "configSection": "corp",
    "sshHost": "git.example.com:2222",
    "cloneRoot": "~/projects"
  }
}
```

`WUKONG_GITLAB_URL`, `WUKONG_GITLAB_SECTION`, `WUKONG_GITLAB_SSH_HOST`, `WUKONG_GITLAB_COMMAND`
and `WUKONG_CLONE_ROOT` take precedence. The URL must be https. Install
[python-gitlab](https://python-gitlab.readthedocs.io/) (`uv tool install python-gitlab`) and
configure it as usual (`~/.python-gitlab.cfg`, including credential helpers). Paseo never sees the
token.

Merge request status, checks, merge, auto-merge and issues run through upstream's GitLab service.
A glab-compatible runner (`packages/server/src/wukong/gitlab/glab-runner.ts`) answers the `glab`
command lines that service issues with python-gitlab calls; no `glab` executable is involved. Not
supported: rebase merges. The daemon's clone request clones only from this GitLab.

## Building the packages yourself

Needs Node.js 22+ and Git. Works the same on Windows (PowerShell or cmd), macOS and Linux:

```sh
git clone -b wukong https://github.com/quickwind/wukong.git
cd wukong
node wukong/scripts/pack-local.mjs --out ../wukong-dist
```

It checks out the last commit into a throwaway folder, applies the npm scope and the brand,
installs, builds (including the web UI) and writes seven `wukong-*.tgz` files to `--out`. Nothing
is published. Takes about ten minutes the first time. Then follow `wukong/INSTALL-WINDOWS.md`.

- Only committed work is included. Commit your changes first.
- Tarballs of an earlier build in `--out` are removed first, so the folder always holds one build.
- `--scope acme` builds `@acme/*` instead of `@wukong/*`; `--work-dir C:\wk` picks the build
  folder (keep it short on Windows); `--keep` leaves the folder in place.
- `git config core.autocrlf` may be `true` on Windows; the build copes with CRLF.

## Publishing

`wukong-publish.yml` runs on every push to `wukong`. It verifies, then (once `NPM_SCOPE` is set)
rewrites the npm scope and the brand in a throwaway checkout, builds with `EXPO_PUBLIC_WUKONG=1`,
publishes `<version>-wukong.<run>` for the seven packages and keeps the tarballs as an artifact.

1. Choose the registry and scope (GitHub Packages, npmjs or an internal registry).
2. Repository variables: `NPM_SCOPE` (required), `NPM_REGISTRY`, `NPM_ACCESS` (`restricted` by
   default).
3. Create the `npm-publish` environment and add `NPM_TOKEN` (not needed for GitHub Packages).
4. Run `wukong/scripts/disable-upstream-workflows.sh <owner/repo>` once to turn off upstream
   workflows that cannot work in the fork.

Install all seven packages together, otherwise npm pulls the upstream versions from the public
registry:

```sh
npm install -g @<scope>/cli @<scope>/server @<scope>/client @<scope>/protocol @<scope>/relay \
  @<scope>/plugin @<scope>/highlight
wukong daemon start        # http://127.0.0.1:6899, data in ~/.wukong
```

Tag releases with a prefix other than `v` (for example `wukong-20261010`): upstream's release
workflows trigger on `v*`.

## Staying in sync

`main` mirrors upstream; `wukong` is `main` plus Wukong. `wukong-sync-upstream.yml` runs weekly,
fast-forwards `main`, merges it into a `sync/upstream-*` branch, runs the brand and Wukong tests
and the typecheck, and opens a pull request. A conflict opens an issue naming the files. Run the
same merge locally with `git config rerere.enabled true` and a conflict you resolved once is
resolved the same way next time.

Three tests fail loudly when an upstream change needs attention, instead of letting a build ship
half-adapted:

- `wukong/scripts/brand.test.mjs`: a brand rule no longer matches, or a replaced file changed.
- `packages/server/src/wukong/gitlab/glab-runner.test.ts`: upstream changed a `glab` command line.
- `packages/server/src/wukong/plugins.test.ts` and `providers.test.ts`: a hook moved.

## Not covered

- Nothing intercepts what the provider CLIs themselves send; they reach their own services.
- The egress guard does not see DNS lookups or UDP.
- Pairing links: the option is hidden in Settings, but the welcome screen and `/pair-scan` still
  accept a pasted link, which is a deliberate user action.
- Links to `paseo.sh/docs` remain; they open only when clicked.
- The GitLab integration has not been run against a live GitLab (version 19.0 in particular):
  start with auto-merge, which python-gitlab exposes only through the older parameter.
